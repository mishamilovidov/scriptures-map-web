## IS 542 - Project 1b ##
### Misha Milovidov ###

#### Feedback From Non-IS 542 Student ####
* Make it more clear that the breadcrumbs are clickable on mobile
    * I tried to improve this by underlining the breadcrumbs.
* Provide a key for the symbols next to placenames on the map markers
    * I didn't have time to add this improvement.

#### Learning Experience ####
* This project helped me with my understanding of flexbox
* It was difficult implementing a simple way to animate when the hash changes because I had to debug through the code to remember where my html was being generated
* If I were to do this again, I would start at mobile and start with design elements like animation in mind
